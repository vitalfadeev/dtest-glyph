Eliptical gradient
==================

There are a few ways to define an elipse but having thought about it I think it is most useful to have a general method that takes three points,

the center of the elipse
the location of 0 degrees for the elipse
the location of 90 degrees for the elipse

This allows mapping any linear transform to be supported. 

so we have

center : (x0,y0)
axis0 : (x1,y1)
axis1 : (x2,y2)

We can calculate t0 and t1 as described in paintmap.txt

from which you can evaluate the radius or angle for the elipse...

r = sqrt(t0^2+t1^2)

or the angle

a = atan2(t1,t0)

Other ways to define the elipse can be built on top of this. If you want a circle, a center point and the location of 0 degress on the circumference can easily be converted into three points for example.

circle = x0,y0,x1,y1

which becomes...

p0 = x0,y0
p1 = x1,y1
p2 = x0-(y1-y0),y0+(x1-x0)

IE. We just define p2 as the same radius at right angle to p1

An elipse can also be deined with a center point, and edge point and an aspect ratio

elipse = x0,y0,x1,y1,r

p0 = x0,y0
p1 = x1,y1
p2 = x0-r*(y1-y0),y0+r*(x1-x0)
